*!
*! DESCRIPTION : This is the header file for the machine description for 
*!		 the Java Virtual Machine.
*!
*!		 Note that this machine description is based on the CRIS
*!		 architecture so some portions of this file may not be
*!		 relevant to the JVM (I never really got around to triming 
*!		 the fat).  The CRIS architecture was selected because the 
*!		 machine description files were heavily documented, not 
*!		 because of any similarity with the JVM.

 `INCLUDE_DEFAULTS'
      Define this macro if you wish to override the entire default

      `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR', `LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR', `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR',
      `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR', and `STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR'.  In addition,
      `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' and `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR' are defined
      automatically by `Makefile', and specify private search areas for
      GCC.  The directory `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only for C++
      programs.

      The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures.
      Each array element should have two elements: the directory name (a
      string constant) and a flag for C++-only directories.  Mark the
      end of the array with a null element.  For example, here is the
      definition used for VMS:

           #define INCLUDE_DEFAULTS \
           {                                       \

   2. The environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

   3. The directories specified by the environment variable

 `CPP_PREDEFINES'
      Define this to be a string constant containing `-D' options to

      These macros will be predefined unless the `-ansi' option is

      In addition, a parallel set of macros are predefined, whose names
      are made by appending `__' at the beginning and at the end.  These
      `__' macros are permitted by the ANSI standard, so they are
      predefined regardless of whether `-ansi' is specified.

      For example, on the Sun, one can use the following value:

           "-Dmc68000 -Dsun -Dunix"

      The result is to define the macros `__mc68000__', `__sun__' and

/*
 `TARGET_...'
      This series of macros is to allow compiler command arguments to
      enable or disable the use of optional features of the target
      machine.  For example, one machine description serves both the
      68000 and the 68020; a command argument tells the compiler whether
      it should use 68020-only instructions or not.  This command
      argument works by means of a macro `TARGET_68020' that tests a bit
      in `target_flags'.

      Define a macro `TARGET_FEATURENAME' for each such option.  Its
      definition should test a bit in `target_flags'; for example:

           #define TARGET_68020 (target_flags & 1)

      One place where these macros are used is in the
      condition-expressions of instruction patterns.  Note how
      `TARGET_68020' appears frequently in the 68000 machine description
      file, `m68k.md'.  Another place they are used is in the
      definitions of the other macros in the `MACHINE.h' file.

/*
 `TARGET_SWITCHES'
      This macro defines names of command options to set and clear bits
      in `target_flags'.  Its definition is an initializer with a
      subgrouping for each command option.

      Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the
      option name, and a number, which contains the bits to set in
      `target_flags'.  A negative number says to clear bits instead; the
      negative of the number is which bits to clear.  The actual option
      name is made by appending `-m' to the specified name.

      One of the subgroupings should have a null string.  The number in
      this grouping is the default value for `target_flags'.  Any target
      options act starting with that value.

      Here is an example which defines `-m68000' and `-m68020' with
      opposite meanings, and picks the latter as the default:

           #define TARGET_SWITCHES \
             { { "68020", 1},      \
               { "68000", -1},     \

 `TARGET_OPTIONS'
      This macro is similar to `TARGET_SWITCHES' but defines names of
      command options that have values.  Its definition is an
      initializer with a subgrouping for each command option.

      Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the
      fixed part of the option name, and the address of a variable.  The
      variable, type `char *', is set to the variable part of the given
      option if the fixed part matches.  The actual option name is made
      by appending `-m' to the specified name.

      Here is an example which defines `-mshort-data-NUMBER'.  If the
      given option is `-mshort-data-512', the variable `m88k_short_data'

/*
 `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS'
      Define this if you wish to imitate the way many other C compilers
      handle alignment of bitfields and the structures that contain them.

      The behavior is that the type written for a bitfield (`int',
      `short', or other integer type) imposes an alignment for the
      entire structure, as if the structure really did contain an
      ordinary field of that type.  In addition, the bitfield is placed
      within the structure so that it would fit within such a field, not
      crossing a boundary for it.

      Thus, on most machines, a bitfield whose type is written as `int'
      would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force four-byte
      alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used may not be
      four bytes; it is controlled by the other alignment parameters.)

      If the macro is defined, its definition should be a C expression;
      a nonzero value for the expression enables this behavior.

      Note that if this macro is not defined, or its value is zero, some
      bitfields may cross more than one alignment boundary.  The
      compiler can support such references if there are `insv', `extv',
      and `extzv' insns that can directly reference memory.

      The other known way of making bitfields work is to define
      `STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' as large as `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.  Then
      every structure can be accessed with fullwords.

      Unless the machine has bitfield instructions or you define
      `STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' that way, you must define
      `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' to have a nonzero value.

      If your aim is to make GNU CC use the same conventions for laying
      out bitfields as are used by another compiler, here is how to
      investigate what the other compiler does.  Compile and run this
      program:

           struct foo1
           {
             char x;
             char :0;
             char y;
           };

           struct foo2
           {
             char x;
             int :0;
             char y;
           };

           main ()
           {
             printf ("Size of foo1 is %d\n",
                     sizeof (struct foo1));
             printf ("Size of foo2 is %d\n",
                     sizeof (struct foo2));
             exit (0);
           }

      If this prints 2 and 5, then the compiler's behavior is what you
      would get from `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS'.

 `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (REGNO, MODE)'
      A C expression that is nonzero if it is permissible to store a

      registers starting with that one).  For a machine where all
      registers are equivalent, a suitable definition is

           #define HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK(REGNO, MODE) 1

      It is not necessary for this macro to check for the numbers of
      fixed registers, because the allocation mechanism considers them
      to be always occupied.

      On some machines, double-precision values must be kept in even/odd
      register pairs.  The way to implement that is to define this macro
      to reject odd register numbers for such modes.

      The minimum requirement for a mode to be OK in a register is that
      the `movMODE' instruction pattern support moves between the
      register and any other hard register for which the mode is OK; and
      that moving a value into the register and back out not alter it.

      Since the same instruction used to move `SImode' will work for all
      narrower integer modes, it is not necessary on any machine for
      `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' to distinguish between these modes, provided
      you define patterns `movhi', etc., to take advantage of this.  This
      is useful because of the interaction between `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'
      and `MODES_TIEABLE_P'; it is very desirable for all integer modes
      to be tieable.

      Many machines have special registers for floating point arithmetic.
      Often people assume that floating point machine modes are allowed
      only in floating point registers.  This is not true.  Any
      registers that can hold integers can safely *hold* a floating
      point machine mode, whether or not floating arithmetic can be done
      on it in those registers.  Integer move instructions can be used
      to move the values.

      On some machines, though, the converse is true: fixed-point machine
      modes may not go in floating registers.  This is true if the
      floating registers normalize any value stored in them, because
      storing a non-floating value there would garble it.  In this case,
      `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' should reject fixed-point machine modes in
      floating registers.  But if the floating registers do not
      automatically normalize, if you can store any bit pattern in one
      and retrieve it unchanged without a trap, then any machine mode
      may go in a floating register, so you can define this macro to say
      so.

      The primary significance of special floating registers is rather
      that they are the registers acceptable in floating point arithmetic
      instructions.  However, this is of no concern to
      `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.  You handle it by writing the proper
      constraints for those instructions.

      On some machines, the floating registers are especially slow to
      access, so that it is better to store a value in a stack frame
      than in such a register if floating point arithmetic is not being
      done.  As long as the floating registers are not in class
      `GENERAL_REGS', they will not be used unless some pattern's
      constraint asks for one.

 `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS (X, CLASS)'

 `SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)'
 `SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)'
 `SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)'
      Many machines have some registers that cannot be copied directly
      to or from memory or even from other types of registers.  An
      example is the `MQ' register, which on most machines, can only be
      copied to or from general registers, but not memory.  Some
      machines allow copying all registers to and from memory, but
      require a scratch register for stores to some memory locations
      (e.g., those with symbolic address on the RT, and those with
      certain symbolic address on the Sparc when compiling PIC).  In
      some cases, both an intermediate and a scratch register are
      required.

      You should define these macros to indicate to the reload phase
      that it may need to allocate at least one register for a reload in
      addition to the register to contain the data.  Specifically, if
      copying X to a register CLASS in MODE requires an intermediate
      register, you should define `SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' to
      return the largest register class all of whose registers can be
      used as intermediate registers or scratch registers.

      If copying a register CLASS in MODE to X requires an intermediate
      or scratch register, `SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' should be
      defined to return the largest register class required.  If the
      requirements for input and output reloads are the same, the macro
      `SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS' should be used instead of defining both
      macros identically.

      The values returned by these macros are often `GENERAL_REGS'.
      Return `NO_REGS' if no spare register is needed; i.e., if X can be
      directly copied to or from a register of CLASS in MODE without
      requiring a scratch register.  Do not define this macro if it
      would always return `NO_REGS'.

      If a scratch register is required (either with or without an
      intermediate register), you should define patterns for
      `reload_inM' or `reload_outM', as required (*note Standard
      Names::..  These patterns, which will normally be implemented with
      a `define_expand', should be similar to the `movM' patterns,
      except that operand 2 is the scratch register.

      Define constraints for the reload register and scratch register
      that contain a single register class.  If the original reload
      register (whose class is CLASS) can meet the constraint given in
      the pattern, the value returned by these macros is used for the
      class of the scratch register.  Otherwise, two additional reload
      registers are required.  Their classes are obtained from the
      constraints in the insn pattern.

      X might be a pseudo-register or a `subreg' of a pseudo-register,
      which could either be in a hard register or in memory.  Use
      `true_regnum' to find out; it will return -1 if the pseudo is in
      memory and the hard register number if it is in a register.

      These macros should not be used in the case where a particular
      class of registers can only be copied to memory and not to another
      class of registers.  In that case, secondary reload registers are
      not needed and would not be helpful.  Instead, a stack location
      must be used to perform the copy and the `movM' pattern should use
      memory as a intermediate storage.  This case often occurs between
      floating-point and general registers.

 `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED (CLASS1, CLASS2, M)'

      registers of class CLASS2 by storing a register of CLASS1 into

      copies.  If this macro is defined, the compiler instead uses the
      memory location defined by this macro.

      Do not define this macro if you do not define

*/
/* No definition */


/*
 `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_MODE (MODE)'
      When the compiler needs a secondary memory location to copy
      between two registers of mode MODE, it normally allocates
      sufficient memory to hold a quantity of `BITS_PER_WORD' bits and
      performs the store and load operations in a mode that many bits
      wide and whose class is the same as that of MODE.

      This is right thing to do on most machines because it ensures that
      all bits of the register are copied and prevents accesses to the
      registers in a narrower mode, which some machines prohibit for
      floating-point registers.

      However, this default behavior is not correct on some machines,
      such as the DEC Alpha, that store short integers in floating-point
      registers differently than in integer registers.  On those
      machines, the default widening will not work correctly and you
      must define this macro to suppress that widening in some cases.
      See the file `alpha.h' for details.

      Do not define this macro if you do not define
      `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED' or if widening MODE to a mode that is
      `BITS_PER_WORD' bits wide is correct for your machine.

/*
 `SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES'
      Normally the compiler avoids choosing registers that have been
      explicitly mentioned in the rtl as spill registers (these
      registers are normally those used to pass parameters and return
      values).  However, some machines have so few registers of certain
      classes that there would not be enough registers to use as spill
      registers if this were done.

      Define `SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES' on these machines.  When it is
      defined, the compiler allows registers explicitly used in the rtl
      to be used as spill registers but avoids extending the lifetime of
      these registers.

      It is always safe to define this macro, but if you unnecessarily
      define it, you will reduce the amount of optimizations that can be
      performed in some cases.  If you do not define this macro when it
      is required, the compiler will run out of spill registers and
      print a fatal error message.  For most machines, you should not

 `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED'
      A C expression which is nonzero if a function must have and use a

      or the constant 1 suffices.  Use 0 when the machine allows code to

      allocated for arguments in registers is not a simple constant
      independent of the function declaration.

      The value of the first macro is the size, in bytes, of the area
      that we should initially assume would be reserved for arguments
      passed in registers.

      The value of the second macro is the actual size, in bytes, of the

 `RETURN_POPS_ARGS (FUNDECL, FUNTYPE, STACK-SIZE)'
      A C expression that should indicate the number of bytes of its own
      arguments that a function pops on returning, or 0 if the function
      pops no arguments and the caller must therefore pop them all after
      the function returns.

      FUNDECL is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
      the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
      `FUNCTION_DECL' that describes the declaration of the function.
      From this it is possible to obtain the DECL_MACHINE_ATTRIBUTES of
      the function.

      FUNTYPE is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
      the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
      `FUNCTION_TYPE' that describes the data type of the function.
      From this it is possible to obtain the data types of the value and
      arguments (if known).

      When a call to a library function is being considered, FUNTYPE
      will contain an identifier node for the library function.  Thus, if
      you need to distinguish among various library functions, you can
      do so by their names.  Note that "library function" in this
      context means a function used to perform arithmetic, whose name is
      known specially in the compiler and was not mentioned in the C
      code being compiled.

      STACK-SIZE is the number of bytes of arguments passed on the
      stack.  If a variable number of bytes is passed, it is zero, and
      argument popping will always be the responsibility of the calling
      function.

      On the Vax, all functions always pop their arguments, so the
      definition of this macro is STACK-SIZE.  On the 68000, using the
      standard calling convention, no functions pop their arguments, so
      the value of the macro is always 0 in this case.  But an
      alternative calling convention is available in which functions
      that take a fixed number of arguments pop them but other functions
      (such as `printf') pop nothing (the caller pops all).  When this
      convention is in use, FUNTYPE is examined to determine whether a
      function takes a fixed number of arguments.

 `FUNCTION_ARG (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
      A C expression that controls whether a function argument is passed
      in a register, and which register.

      The arguments are CUM, which summarizes all the previous
      arguments; MODE, the machine mode of the argument; TYPE, the data
      type of the argument as a tree node or 0 if that is not known
      (which happens for C support library functions); and NAMED, which
      is 1 for an ordinary argument and 0 for nameless arguments that
      correspond to `...' in the called function's prototype.

      The value of the expression should either be a `reg' RTX for the
      hard register in which to pass the argument, or zero to pass the
      argument on the stack.

      For machines like the Vax and 68000, where normally all arguments
      are pushed, zero suffices as a definition.

      The usual way to make the ANSI library `stdarg.h' work on a machine
      where some arguments are usually passed in registers, is to cause
      nameless arguments to be passed on the stack instead.  This is done
      by making `FUNCTION_ARG' return 0 whenever NAMED is 0.

 `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE (FILE, SIZE)'
      A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for entry
      to a function.  The prologue is responsible for setting up the
      stack frame, initializing the frame pointer register, saving
      registers that must be saved, and allocating SIZE additional bytes
      of storage for the local variables.  SIZE is an integer.  FILE is
      a stdio stream to which the assembler code should be output.

      The label for the beginning of the function need not be output by
      this macro.  That has already been done when the macro is run.

      To determine which registers to save, the macro can refer to the
      array `regs_ever_live': element R is nonzero if hard register R is
      used anywhere within the function.  This implies the function
      prologue should save register R, provided it is not one of the
      call-used registers.  (`FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must likewise use
      `regs_ever_live'.)

      On machines that have "register windows", the function entry code
      does not save on the stack the registers that are in the windows,
      even if they are supposed to be preserved by function calls;
      instead it takes appropriate steps to "push" the register stack,
      if any non-call-used registers are used in the function.

      On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
      function entry code must vary accordingly; it must set up the frame
      pointer if one is wanted, and not otherwise.  To determine whether
      a frame pointer is in wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
      `frame_pointer_needed'.  The variable's value will be 1 at run
      time in a function that needs a frame pointer.  *Note
      Elimination::.

      The function entry code is responsible for allocating any stack
      space required for the function.  This stack space consists of the
      regions listed below.  In most cases, these regions are allocated
      in the order listed, with the last listed region closest to the
      top of the stack (the lowest address if `STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is
      defined, and the highest address if it is not defined).  You can
      use a different order for a machine if doing so is more convenient
      or required for compatibility reasons.  Except in cases where
      required by standard or by a debugger, there is no reason why the
      stack layout used by GCC need agree with that used by other
      compilers for a machine.

         * A region of `current_function_pretend_args_size' bytes of
           uninitialized space just underneath the first argument
           arriving on the stack.  (This may not be at the very start of
           the allocated stack region if the calling sequence has pushed
           anything else since pushing the stack arguments.  But
           usually, on such machines, nothing else has been pushed yet,
           because the function prologue itself does all the pushing.)
           This region is used on machines where an argument may be
           passed partly in registers and partly in memory, and, in some
           cases to support the features in `varargs.h' and `stdargs.h'.

         * An area of memory used to save certain registers used by the
           function.  The size of this area, which may also include
           space for such things as the return address and pointers to
           previous stack frames, is machine-specific and usually
           depends on which registers have been used in the function.
           Machines with register windows often do not require a save
           area.

         * A region of at least SIZE bytes, possibly rounded up to an
           allocation boundary, to contain the local variables of the
           function.  On some machines, this region and the save area
           may occur in the opposite order, with the save area closer to
           the top of the stack.

         * Optionally, when `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is defined, a
           region of `current_function_outgoing_args_size' bytes to be
           used for outgoing argument lists of the function.  *Note
           Stack Arguments::.

      Normally, it is necessary for the macros `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and

 `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE (FILE, SIZE)'
      A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for exit

      saved registers and stack pointer to their values when the
      function was called, and returning control to the caller.  This
      macro takes the same arguments as the macro `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE',
      and the registers to restore are determined from `regs_ever_live'
      and `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' in the same way.

      On some machines, there is a single instruction that does all the
      work of returning from the function.  On these machines, give that
      instruction the name `return' and do not define the macro
      `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' at all.

      Do not define a pattern named `return' if you want the
      `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to be used.  If you want the target switches
      to control whether return instructions or epilogues are used,
      define a `return' pattern with a validity condition that tests the
      target switches appropriately.  If the `return' pattern's validity
      condition is false, epilogues will be used.

      On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
      function exit code must vary accordingly.  Sometimes the code for
      these two cases is completely different.  To determine whether a
      frame pointer is wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
      `frame_pointer_needed'.  The variable's value will be 1 when
      compiling a function that needs a frame pointer.

      Normally, `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must treat
      leaf functions specially.  The C variable `leaf_function' is
      nonzero for such a function.  *Note Leaf Functions::.

      On some machines, some functions pop their arguments on exit while
      others leave that for the caller to do.  For example, the 68020
      when given `-mrtd' pops arguments in functions that take a fixed
      number of arguments.

      Your definition of the macro `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' decides which
      functions pop their own arguments.  `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' needs to
      know what was decided.  The variable that is called

/*
 `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS (ARGS_SO_FAR, MODE, TYPE,'
      PRETEND_ARGS_SIZE, SECOND_TIME) This macro offers an alternative
      to using `__builtin_saveregs' and defining the macro
      `EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS'.  Use it to store the anonymous register
      arguments into the stack so that all the arguments appear to have
      been passed consecutively on the stack.  Once this is done, you
      can use the standard implementation of varargs that works for
      machines that pass all their arguments on the stack.

      The argument ARGS_SO_FAR is the `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' data structure,
      containing the values that obtain after processing of the named
      arguments.  The arguments MODE and TYPE describe the last named
      argument--its machine mode and its data type as a tree node.

      The macro implementation should do two things: first, push onto the
      stack all the argument registers *not* used for the named
      arguments, and second, store the size of the data thus pushed into
      the `int'-valued variable whose name is supplied as the argument
      PRETEND_ARGS_SIZE.  The value that you store here will serve as
      additional offset for setting up the stack frame.

      Because you must generate code to push the anonymous arguments at
      compile time without knowing their data types,
      `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' is only useful on machines that have just
      a single category of argument register and use it uniformly for
      all data types.

      If the argument SECOND_TIME is nonzero, it means that the
      arguments of the function are being analyzed for the second time.
      This happens for an inline function, which is not actually
      compiled until the end of the source file.  The macro
      `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' should not generate any instructions in
      this case.
*/

      It usually pays to define several simpler macros to serve as
      subroutines for this one.  Otherwise it may be too complicated to
      understand.

      This macro must exist in two variants: a strict variant and a
      non-strict one.  The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It
      must be defined so that any pseudo-register that has not been
      allocated a hard register is considered a memory reference.  In
      contexts where some kind of register is required, a pseudo-register
      with no hard register must be rejected.

      The non-strict variant is used in other passes.  It must be
      defined to accept all pseudo-registers in every context where some
      kind of register is required.

      Compiler source files that want to use the strict variant of this
      macro define the macro `REG_OK_STRICT'.  You should use an `#ifdef
      REG_OK_STRICT' conditional to define the strict variant in that
      case and the non-strict variant otherwise.

      Subroutines to check for acceptable registers for various purposes
      (one for base registers, one for index registers, and so on) are
      typically among the subroutines used to define
      `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS'.  Then only these subroutine macros
      need have two variants; the higher levels of macros may be the
      same whether strict or not.

      Normally, constant addresses which are the sum of a `symbol_ref'
      and an integer are stored inside a `const' RTX to mark them as
      constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums
      specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply
      recognize any `const' as legitimate.

      Usually `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS' is not prepared to handle constant
      sums that are not marked with  `const'.  It assumes that a naked
      `plus' indicates indexing.  If so, then you *must* reject such
      naked constant sums as illegitimate addresses, so that none of
      them will be given to `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS'.

      On some machines, whether a symbolic address is legitimate depends
      on the section that the address refers to.  On these machines,
      define the macro `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' to store the information
      into the `symbol_ref', and then check for it here.  When you see a
      `const', you will have to look inside it to find the `symbol_ref'
      in order to determine the section.  *Note Assembler Format::.

      The best way to modify the name string is by adding text to the
      beginning, with suitable punctuation to prevent any ambiguity.
      Allocate the new name in `saveable_obstack'.  You will have to
      modify `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' to remove and decode the added text
      and output the name accordingly, and define `STRIP_NAME_ENCODING'
      to access the original name string.

      You can check the information stored here into the `symbol_ref' in
      the definitions of the macros `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS' and
      `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS'.
*/
/*
   The other macros defined here are used only in GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS,
   except for CONSTANT_ADDRESS_P which is actually machine-independent.

   Note that you HAVE TO reject illegal addressing modes for mode
   MODE, even if it is legal for normal addressing modes.  You cannot
   rely on the constraints to do this work.  They can only be used to
   doublecheck your intentions.  One example is that you HAVE TO reject
   (mem:DI (plus:SI (reg:SI x) (reg:SI y))) because for some reason
   this cannot be reloaded.  (Which of course you can argue that gcc
   should have done.)

 `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC (EXP, INSN)'

      code as a byproduct of other activity as well as those that
      explicitly set `(cc0)'.

      This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.

      If there are insns that do not set the condition code but do alter
      other machine registers, this macro must check to see whether they
      invalidate the expressions that the condition code is recorded as
      reflecting.  For example, on the 68000, insns that store in address
      registers do not set the condition code, which means that usually
      `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' can leave `cc_status' unaltered for such insns.
      But suppose that the previous insn set the condition code based
      on location `a4@(102)' and the current insn stores a new value in
      `a4'.  Although the condition code is not changed by this, it will
      no longer be true that it reflects the contents of `a4@(102)'.
      Therefore, `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must alter `cc_status' in this case
      to say that nothing is known about the condition code value.

      The definition of `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must be prepared to deal with
      the results of peephole optimization: insns whose patterns are
      `parallel' RTXs containing various `reg', `mem' or constants which
      are just the operands.  The RTL structure of these insns is not
      sufficient to indicate what the insns actually do.  What
      `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' should do when it sees one is just to run
      `CC_STATUS_INIT'.

      A possible definition of `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' is to call a function
      that looks at an attribute (*note Insn Attributes::.) named, for

/*
 `ADDRESS_COST (ADDRESS)'
      An expression giving the cost of an addressing mode that contains
      ADDRESS.  If not defined, the cost is computed from the ADDRESS
      expression and the `CONST_COSTS' values.

      For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation
      of the true cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC
      machines, all instructions normally have the same length and
      execution time.  Hence all addresses will have equal costs.

      In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form
      with the lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the
      same, lowest, cost, the one that is the most complex will be used.

      For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a
      register and a constant is used twice in the same basic block.
      When this macro is not defined, the address will be computed in a
      register and memory references will be indirect through that
      register.  On machines where the cost of the addressing mode
      containing the sum is no higher than that of a simple indirect
      reference, this will produce an additional instruction and
      possibly require an additional register.  Proper specification of
      this macro eliminates this overhead for such machines.

      Similar use of this macro is made in strength reduction of loops.

      ADDRESS need not be valid as an address.  In such a case, the cost
      is not relevant and can be any value; invalid addresses need not be
      assigned a different cost.

      On machines where an address involving more than one register is as
      cheap as an address computation involving only one register,
      defining `ADDRESS_COST' to reflect this can cause two registers to
      be live over a region of code where only one would have been if
      `ADDRESS_COST' were not defined in that manner.  This effect should
      be considered in the definition of this macro.  Equivalent costs
      should probably only be given to addresses with different numbers
      of registers on machines with lots of registers.

      This macro will normally either not be defined or be defined as a
      constant.

 `REGISTER_MOVE_COST (FROM, TO)'
      A C expression for the cost of moving data from a register in class
      FROM to one in class TO.  The classes are expressed using the
      enumeration values such as `GENERAL_REGS'.  A value of 4 is the
      default; other values are interpreted relative to that.

      It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when FROM is the
      same as TO; on some machines it is expensive to move between
      registers if they are not general registers.

      If reload sees an insn consisting of a single `set' between two
      hard registers, and if `REGISTER_MOVE_COST' applied to their
      classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that

      2 will allow reload to verify that the constraints are met.  You

 `ASM_OUTPUT_SPECIAL_POOL_ENTRY (FILE, X, MODE, ALIGN, LABELNO, JUMPTO)'
      A C statement (with or without semicolon) to output a constant in
      the constant pool, if it needs special treatment.  (This macro
      need not do anything for RTL expressions that can be output
      normally.)

      The argument FILE is the standard I/O stream to output the
      assembler code on.  X is the RTL expression for the constant to
      output, and MODE is the machine mode (in case X is a `const_int').
      ALIGN is the required alignment for the value X; you should
      output an assembler directive to force this much alignment.

      The argument LABELNO is a number to use in an internal label for
      the address of this pool entry.  The definition of this macro is
      responsible for outputting the label definition at the proper
      place.  Here is how to do this:

           ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (FILE, "LC", LABELNO);

      When you output a pool entry specially, you should end with a
      `goto' to the label JUMPTO.  This will prevent the same pool entry
      from being output a second time in the usual manner.

      You need not define this macro if it would do nothing.

      BUF is an expression of type `char *' which gives you a buffer in
      which to store the name; its length is as long as CLASS_NAME,
      CAT_NAME and SEL_NAME put together, plus 50 characters extra.

      The argument IS_INST specifies whether the method is an instance
      method or a class method; CLASS_NAME is the name of the class;
      CAT_NAME is the name of the category (or NULL if the method is not
      in a category); and SEL_NAME is the name of the selector.

      On systems where the assembler can handle quoted names, you can
      use this macro to provide more human-readable names.

 `ASM_OUTPUT_OPCODE (STREAM, PTR)'
      Define this macro if you are using an unusual assembler that
      requires different names for the machine instructions.

      The definition is a C statement or statements which output an
      assembler instruction opcode to the stdio stream STREAM.  The
      macro-operand PTR is a variable of type `char *' which points to
      the opcode name in its "internal" form--the form that is written
      in the machine description.  The definition should output the
      opcode name to STREAM, performing any translation you desire, and
      increment the variable PTR to point at the end of the opcode so
      that it will not be output twice.

      In fact, your macro definition may process less than the entire
      opcode name, or more than the opcode name; but if you want to
      process text that includes `%'-sequences to substitute operands,
      you must take care of the substitution yourself.  Just be sure to
      increment PTR over whatever text should not be output normally.

      If you need to look at the operand values, they can be found as the
      elements of `recog_operand'.

      CODE is a value that can be used to specify one of several ways of

      The names can be found in an array `reg_names' whose type is `char

 `PREDICATE_CODES'
      Define this if you have defined special-purpose predicates in the
      file `MACHINE.c'.  This macro is called within an initializer of an
      array of structures.  The first field in the structure is the name
      of a predicate and the second field is an array of rtl codes.  For
      each predicate, list all rtl codes that can be in expressions
      matched by the predicate.  The list should have a trailing comma.
      Here is an example of two entries in the list for a typical RISC
      machine:

           #define PREDICATE_CODES \
             {"gen_reg_rtx_operand", {SUBREG, REG}},  \
             {"reg_or_short_cint_operand", {SUBREG, REG, CONST_INT}},

      Defining this macro does not affect the generated code (however,
      incorrect definitions that omit an rtl code that may be matched by
      the predicate can cause the compiler to malfunction).  Instead, it
      allows the table built by `genrecog' to be more compact and
      efficient, thus speeding up the compiler.  The most important
      predicates to include in the list specified by this macro are
      thoses used in the most insn patterns.

 `SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED'

      the number of bits needed to represent the size of the object
      being shifted.  When this macro is non-zero, the compiler will
      assume that it is safe to omit a sign-extend, zero-extend, and
      certain bitwise `and' instructions that truncates the count of a
      shift operation.  On machines that have instructions that act on
      bitfields at variable positions, which may include `bit test'
      instructions, a nonzero `SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' also enables
      deletion of truncations of the values that serve as arguments to

      If both types of instructions truncate the count (for shifts) and

      bitfield instructions exist, you should define this macro.

      However, on some machines, such as the 80386 and the 680x0,
      truncation only applies to shift operations and not the (real or
      pretended) bitfield operations.  Define `SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' to

/*
 `STORE_FLAG_VALUE'
      A C expression describing the value returned by a comparison
      operator with an integral mode and stored by a store-flag
      instruction (`sCOND') when the condition is true.  This
      description must apply to *all* the `sCOND' patterns and all the
      comparison operators whose results have a `MODE_INT' mode.

      A value of 1 or -1 means that the instruction implementing the
      comparison operator returns exactly 1 or -1 when the comparison is
      true and 0 when the comparison is false.  Otherwise, the value
      indicates which bits of the result are guaranteed to be 1 when the
      comparison is true.  This value is interpreted in the mode of the
      comparison operation, which is given by the mode of the first
      operand in the `sCOND' pattern.  Either the low bit or the sign
      bit of `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' be on.  Presently, only those bits are
      used by the compiler.

      If `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is neither 1 or -1, the compiler will
      generate code that depends only on the specified bits.  It can also
      replace comparison operators with equivalent operations if they
      cause the required bits to be set, even if the remaining bits are
      undefined.  For example, on a machine whose comparison operators
      return an `SImode' value and where `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is defined as
      `0x80000000', saying that just the sign bit is relevant, the
      expression

           (ne:SI (and:SI X (const_int POWER-OF-2)) (const_int 0))

      can be converted to

           (ashift:SI X (const_int N))

      where N is the appropriate shift count to move the bit being
      tested into the sign bit.

      There is no way to describe a machine that always sets the
      low-order bit for a true value, but does not guarantee the value
      of any other bits, but we do not know of any machine that has such
      an instruction.  If you are trying to port GNU CC to such a
      machine, include an instruction to perform a logical-and of the
      result with 1 in the pattern for the comparison operators and let
      us know (*note How to Report Bugs: Bug Reporting.).

      Often, a machine will have multiple instructions that obtain a
      value from a comparison (or the condition codes).  Here are rules
      to guide the choice of value for `STORE_FLAG_VALUE', and hence the
      instructions to be used:

         * Use the shortest sequence that yields a valid definition for
           `STORE_FLAG_VALUE'.  It is more efficient for the compiler to
           "normalize" the value (convert it to, e.g., 1 or 0) than for
           the comparison operators to do so because there may be
           opportunities to combine the normalization with other
           operations.

         * For equal-length sequences, use a value of 1 or -1, with -1
           being slightly preferred on machines with expensive jumps and
           1 preferred on other machines.

         * As a second choice, choose a value of `0x80000001' if
           instructions exist that set both the sign and low-order bits
           but do not define the others.

         * Otherwise, use a value of `0x80000000'.

      Many machines can produce both the value chosen for
      `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' and its negation in the same number of
      instructions.  On those machines, you should also define a pattern
      for those cases, e.g., one matching

           (set A (neg:M (ne:M B C)))

      Some machines can also perform `and' or `plus' operations on
      condition code values with less instructions than the corresponding
      `sCOND' insn followed by `and' or `plus'.  On those machines,
      define the appropriate patterns.  Use the names `incscc' and
      `decscc', respectively, for the the patterns which perform `plus'
      or `minus' operations on condition code values.  See `rs6000.md'
      for some examples.  The GNU Superoptizer can be used to find such
      instruction sequences on other machines.

      You need not define `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the machine has no
      store-flag instructions.
