This is the JVM port of EGCS.  See http://www.csee.uq.edu.au/csm/ for
details.  The following directories should be present:

  build-java    Contains utilities for building JVM targeted C
                    files and some example programs.
  egcs-1.1.2    This contains some modifications to the egcs 1.1.2 source
                    files. You need to install egcs 1.1.2 here, then untar
                    egcs-jvm.tar again to get the modified files. Pick the
                    most convenient mirror site from this page:
                    http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html
                    gcc-jvm is unlikely to work with versions of egcs other than
                    1.1.2, without at least minor changes.
                    See the README.jvm file in this directory for making the
                    compiler.
  runtime       The runtime support class

You also need jasmin (a Java assembler) installed and in your path. The Jasmin
home page is http://found.cs.nyu.edu/meyer/jasmin (or you could try
http://mrl.nyu.edu/meyer/jvm/jasmin.html); you can download Jasmin from that
page. Jasmin is written in Java.

This port is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL.  Do not expect to be able to compile and
run significant programs.
