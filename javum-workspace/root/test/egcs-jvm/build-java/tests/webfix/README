This example is one I just grabbed off the web.  It compiles fine, but it
will not run correctly because the library functions it uses have not been
implemented.  This is a TO DO thing.. so if you feel like implementing
functions like "opendir" in java, look at runtime/TranslatedFile.java.

Need to implement:
	stderr
	fprintf
