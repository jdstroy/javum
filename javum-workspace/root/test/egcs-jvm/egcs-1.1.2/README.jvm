Instructions to compile and use the gcc jvm backend
---------------------------------------------------
In the following instructions, names in UPPERCASE 
relate to directories that may be system dependent
(i.e. you may install them at different locations). 
They do not relate to environment variables that need
to be added to your system.  These names are used 
for ease of explanation.

INSTALLING THE SYSTEM
---------------------
You need several GNU packages to install this backend. 
For Solaris users, we recommend getting the precompiled
packages from 
	http://sunfreeware.com/
Note that the Shell utils package is not available from 
the Sunfreeware site, so you will need to get it from the
GNU site and compile it.
The GNU home page is located at 
	http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/home.html
For a package index check 
	http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/prep/program.index.html
The source code for gcc and egcs is supported by the EGCS group at
	http://egcs.cygnus.com/index.html
and the source code for egcs can be obtained from
	ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/releases/egcs-1.1.2/

Packages
--------
1- egcs 1.1.2 source code: 
   Install the source for egcs 1.1.2 in the same directory where you found
    this file. Call this the SOURCEDIR

2- GNU File Utilities (fileutils-3.15, installs in /opt/FSFfutil, and 
   contains the following files: 
chgrp      cp         dir        install    mkdir      mv         sync
chmod      dd         dircolors  ln         mkfifo     rm         touch
chown      df         du         ls         mknod      rmdir      vdir

Note: if you have a reasonably gnu-friendly system (e.g. Linux) you may not
need to get the above.

3- GNU Binary Utilities (binutils-2.7, installs in /opt/FSFbinut, and 
   contains the following files: 
ar       c++filt  gprof    nm       objdump  size     strip
as       gasp     ld       objcopy  ranlib   strings

Note: As per the above, you may not need the above utilities if your system
is Gnu-friendly.

4- GNU Autoconf (autoconf-2.9, installs in /opt/FSFautoc, and contains 
   the following files: 
autoconf    autoheader  autoreconf  autoscan    autoupdate  ifnames

Note: As per the above, you may not need the above utilities if your system
is Gnu-friendly.

5- GNU Diff utils (diffutils-2.7-sol7-sparc-local, installs in 
   /usr/local, package name GNUdiffut, which contains the following files: 
cmp         diff        diff3       sdiff       

Note: As per the above, you may not need the above utilities if your system
is Gnu-friendly.

6- GNU m4 macro processor (m4-1.4-sol26-sparc-local, installs in 
   /usr/local, and contains the following files: 
m4 

Note: As per the above, you may not need the above macro processor if your
system is Gnu-friendly.

7- GNU Grep (grep-2.0, installs in /opt/FSFgrep, and contains the
   following files: 
egrep  fgrep  grep

Note: As per the above, you may not need the above utilities if your system
is Gnu-friendly.

8- GNU Text utilities (textutils-1.22-sol26-sparc-local, installs in 
   /usr/local, package name FSFtextu, and contains the following files: 
cat	cksum	comm	csplit	cut	expand	  fmt	fold
head	join	md5sum	nl	od	paste	  pr	sort
split	sum	tac	tail	tr	unexpand  uniq	wc

Note: As per the above, you may not need the above utilities if your system
is Gnu-friendly.

9 - GNU Sed (sed-2.05,  installs in /opt/FSFsed, can contains the 
    following file: 
sed

Note: As per the above, you may not need the above utility if your system
is Gnu-friendly.

10- GNU Shell utils (sh-utils-1.16, installs in /usr/local, and contains
    amongst other files these ones: 
basename   dirname   expr   false   sleep   true   

Note: As per the above, you may not need the above utilities if your system
is Gnu-friendly.

You will also need the GNU make program, a gzip program and the 
following commands in your path: 
	cp	ls	mv	rm


Getting gcc_jvm files
---------------------
After getting the egcs 1.1.2 source files, remember to untar gcc-jvm.tar again,
so that files such as config.sub in this directory are overwritten (and in the
gcc directory, config.sub and configure.in). There should be 7 files in
gcc/config/jvm.

Making gcc_jvm on your system
-----------------------------
Make the jvm backend: 
        $ cd gcc
	$ autoconf
	$ cd ../../build-java
 	$ ../egcs-1.1.2/configure jvm
	Created "Makefile" in .../egcs-jvm/build-java
	Links are now set up to build a native compiler for jvm-unknown-none

	$ make rep
 	$ make cross
	(this takes several minutes and fails at link time)
	xgcc: Internal compiler error: program cpp got fatal signal 11


This creates a file called cc1 in the gcc directory, which has the same 
options as gcc plus jasmin support (used in steps below): 
	gcc/cc1 -o foo.j foo.c 	// creates a jasmin file


USING THE SYSTEM
----------------
From the build directory, change to tests, choose an example, change to the
example's directory, and type make.

Changing the system
-------------------
If gcc jvm files are changed, to rebuild the new version of the
system do: 
	change to the build directory
	make clean
	make cross

### this *should* work but may not on some systems. If so, a full
reinstallation of the egcs-1.1.2 sources fixed the problem.
