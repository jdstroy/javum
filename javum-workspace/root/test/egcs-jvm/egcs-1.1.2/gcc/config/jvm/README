The JVM port of EGCS.

The purpose of a C compiler is to convert post processed C code into an
assembly language.  For the JVM port of EGCS I have chosen the Jasmin
assembler which appears to be developing recognision as the java bytecode
assembler of choice.  The current state of this project is promising.
EGCS can successfully compile a C file into a jasmin assembly file that
can be post processed and assembled to produce a class file.  The
resultant class file can then be run on the Java Virtual Machine with
minimal run time support.
