    First there is a comment with the same text as found in the info

 `HOST_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'

 `HOST_FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
      Define this macro to be 1 if the host machine stores `DFmode',
      `XFmode' or `TFmode' floating point numbers in memory with the
      word containing the sign bit at the lowest address; otherwise,
      define it to be zero.

      This macro need not be defined if the ordering is the same as for
      multi-word integers.

 `HOST_FLOAT_FORMAT'

 `ONLY_INT_FIELDS'
      Define this macro to indicate that the host compiler only supports
      `int' bit fields, rather than other integral types, including
      `enum', as do most C compilers.

/* Not defined */


/*
 `OBSTACK_CHUNK_SIZE'
      A C expression for the size of ordinary obstack chunks.  If you
      don't define this, a usually-reasonable default is used.

 `OBSTACK_CHUNK_ALLOC'
      The function used to allocate obstack chunks.  If you don't define
      this, `xmalloc' is used.

      The function used to free obstack chunks.  If you don't define
      this, `free' is used.

/*
 `USE_C_ALLOCA'
      Define this macro to indicate that the compiler is running with the
      `alloca' implemented in C.  This version of `alloca' can be found
      in the file `alloca.c'; to use it, you must also alter the
      `Makefile' variable `ALLOCA'.  (This is done automatically for the
      systems on which we know it is needed.)

      If you do define this macro, you should probably do it as follows:

           #ifndef __GNUC__
           #define USE_C_ALLOCA
           #else
           #define alloca __builtin_alloca
           #endif

      so that when the compiler is compiled with GNU CC it uses the more
      efficient built-in `alloca' function.

/* Not defined */


/*
 `FUNCTION_CONVERSION_BUG'
      Define this macro to indicate that the host compiler does not
      properly handle converting a function value to a
      pointer-to-function when it is used in an expression.

/*
 `HAVE_VPRINTF'
      Define this if the library function `vprintf' is available on your
      system.
*/
/* Not defined */


/*
 `MULTIBYTE_CHARS'
      Define this macro to enable support for multibyte characters in the
      input to GNU CC.  This requires that the host system support the
      ANSI C library functions for converting multibyte characters to
      wide characters.

 `HAVE_PUTENV'
      Define this if the library function `putenv' is available on your

      `sys_siglist'.

 `DONT_DECLARE_SYS_SIGLIST'
      Define this if your system has the variable `sys_siglist', and
      there is already a declaration of it in the system header files.

/* Not defined */


/*
 `USE_PROTOTYPES'
      Define this to be 1 if you know that the host compiler supports
      prototypes, even if it doesn't define __STDC__, or define it to be
      0 if you do not want any prototypes used in compiling GNU CC.  If
      `USE_PROTOTYPES' is not defined, it will be determined
      automatically whether your compiler supports prototypes by
      checking if `__STDC__' is defined.

/* Not defined */


/*
 `NO_MD_PROTOTYPES'
      Define this if you wish suppression of prototypes generated from
      the machine description file, but to use other prototypes within
      GNU CC.  If `USE_PROTOTYPES' is defined to be 0, or the host
      compiler does not support prototypes, this macro has no effect.
*/
/* Not defined */


/*
 `MD_CALL_PROTOTYPES'
      Define this if you wish to generate prototypes for the `gen_call'
      or `gen_call_value' functions generated from the machine
      description file.  If `USE_PROTOTYPES' is defined to be 0, or the
      host compiler does not support prototypes, or `NO_MD_PROTOTYPES'
      is defined, this macro has no effect.  As soon as all of the
      machine descriptions are modified to have the appropriate number
      of arguments, this macro will be removed.

      Some systems do provide this variable, but with a different name
      such as `_sys_siglist'.  On these systems, you can define
      `sys_siglist' as a macro which expands into the name actually
      provided.

/*
 `NO_STAB_H'

/*
 `DIR_SEPARATOR'
      If your system uses some character other than slash to separate
      directory names within a file specification, define this macro to
      be a C character constant specifying that character.  When GNU CC
      displays file names, the character you specify will be used.  GNU
      CC will test for both slash and the character you specify when
      parsing filenames.

/*
 `OBJECT_SUFFIX'
      Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for
      object files on your machine.  If you do not define this macro,

/*
 `EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX'
      Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for

      files.

/*
 `COLLECT_EXPORT_LIST'
      If defined, `collect2' will scan the individual object files
      specified on its command line and create an export list for the

      discards object files that are not referenced from `main' and uses
      export lists.
